# Odin Recipes
This is the first "The Odin Project" exercise.

It takes on the task to apply the basics of HTML and CSS.

It's a begginner friendly code project, that doesn't take long.

It helped me stablish my bases, and taught me that what I wrote in code, could be applied to a live page.

Here is a preview of the page:
